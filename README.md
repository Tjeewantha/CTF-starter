## About The Project

<!--[Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)-->

This is a kind of tool completely written in bash scripting. The main objective of creating this tool is to learn bash scripting AND on the other side, I used to do CTF challenge and I have to create directories every time when I am about to start CTF box. Therefore, I taught if I can build something that can do all those thing for me, it would be better. 

As this is a beginner level shell script, there might not be advance logic on it but I tried my utmost to finish this as product for myself.  

Eureka! I was able to make it work.
